title: "Approximation theory for slice functions"
briefDescription: "Slice functions are function defined over real associative algebras (such as quaternions, octonions, Clifford algebras, ...) induced by special complex functions, the so-called stem function. A key result in this theory is the so-called Splitting Lemma saying that, given a basis of the real associtative algebra as $\\small \\mathbb{C}$-vector space, a slice function is completely described by a sequence of $\\small \\mathbb{C}$-valued complex functions. Hence, the following question arises naturally: if we approximate each $\\small \\mathbb{C}$-valued complex function, do we get an approximation of the slice function?"

Slice functions are function defined over real associative algebras (such as quaternions, octonions, Clifford algebras,...) induced by special complex functions, the so-called stem function. A key result in this theory is the so-called Splitting Lemma saying that, given a basis of the real associtative algebra as `$\small \mathbb{C}$`-vector space, a slice function `$f$` is completely described by a sequence of `$\small \mathbb{C}$`-valued complex functions `$(f_0,\ldots,f_h)$`. Hence, the following question arises naturally: if we consider an approximation of each `$\small \mathbb{C}$`-valued complex function `$f_\ell$`, do we get an approximation of the slice function `$f$`?
