title: "The connectedness of the Hilbert scheme of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves in $\\small \\mathbb{P}^3$"
briefDescription: "I consider this problem as the Problem (with capital P). The Hilbert scheme $\\small \\mathbf{H}_{d,g}$ of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\\small \\mathbb{P}^3$ is an open subscheme of the Hilbert scheme $\\small \\mathbf{Hilb}_{dt+1-g}(\\mathbb{P}^3)$ and contains as open subscheme the Hilbert scheme $\\small \\mathbf{H}^0_{d,g}$ of smooth curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$. The Hilbert scheme $\\small \\mathbf{Hilb}_{dt+1-g}(\\mathbb{P}^3)$ is connected for every pair $(d,g)$, while there are pairs $(d,g)$ for which the Hilbert scheme $\\small \\mathbf{H}^0_{d,g}$ is not connected. What about the Hilbert scheme $\\small \\mathbf{H}_{d,g}$ of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves?"
