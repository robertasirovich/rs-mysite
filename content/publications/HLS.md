**Abstract.** Let `$H_{d,g}$` denote the Hilbert scheme of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves of degree `$d$` and genus `$g$` in projective three space. We show that, given a smooth irreducible curve `$C$` of degree `$d$` and genus `$g$`, there is a rational curve `$\{[C_t]: t \in \mathbb{A}^1\}$` in `$H_{d,g}$` such that `$C_t$` for `$t \neq 0$` is projectively equivalent to `$C$`, while the special fibre `$C_0$` is an extremal curve. It follows that smooth curves lie in a unique connected component of `$H_{d,g}$`. We also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a locally Cohen-Macaulay curve to admit such a specialization to an extremal curve.
