**Abstract.** Let `$J \subset S=K[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$` be a monomial strongly stable ideal. The collection `$\mathbf{Mf}(J)$` of the homogeneous polynomial ideals `$I$`, such that the monomials outside `$J$` form a `$K$`-vector basis of `$S/I$`, is called a _`$J$`-marked family_. It can be endowed with a structure of affine scheme, called a _`$J$`-marked scheme_. For special ideals `$J$`, `$J$`-marked schemes provide an open cover of the Hilbert scheme `$\mathbf{Hilb}_{p(t)}(\mathbb{P}^n)$`, where `$p(t)$` is the Hilbert polynomial of `$S/J$`. Those ideals more suitable to this aim are the `$m$`-truncation ideals `$\underline{J}_{\geqslant m}$` generated by the monomials of degree `$\geqslant m$` in a saturated strongly stable monomial ideal `$\underline{J}$`. Exploiting a characterization of the ideals in `$\mathbf{Mf}(\underline{J}_{\geqslant m})$` in terms of a Buchberger-like criterion, we compute the equations defining the `$\underline{J}_{\geqslant m}$`-marked scheme by a new reduction relation, called _superminimal reduction_, and obtain an embedding of `$\mathbf{Mf}(\underline{J}_{\geqslant m})$` in an affine space of low dimension. In this setting, explicit computations are achievable in many non-trivial cases. Moreover, for every `$m$`, we give a closed embedding `$\phi_m: \mathbf{Mf}(\underline{J}_{\geqslant m}) \hookrightarrow \mathbf{Mf}(\underline{J}_{\geq m+1})$`, characterize those `$\phi_m$` that are isomorphisms in terms of the monomial basis of `$\underline{J}$`, especially we characterize the minimum integer `$m_0$` such that `$\phi_m$` is an isomorphism for every `$m\geqslant m_0$`.
