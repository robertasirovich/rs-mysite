**Abstract.** The goal of this paper is to explicitly detect all the arithmetic genera of arithmetically Cohen–Macaulay projective curves with a given degree `$d$`. It is well-known that the arithmetic genus `$g$` of a curve `$C$` can be easily deduced from the `$h$`-vector of the curve; in the case where `$C$` is arithmetically Cohen–Macaulay of degree `$d$`, `$g$` must belong to the range of integers `$\left\{0,\ldots,\binom{d-1}{2}\right\}$`. We develop an algorithmic procedure that allows one to avoid constructing most of the possible `$h$`-vectors of `$C$`. The essential tools are a combinatorial description of the finite O-sequences of multiplicity `$d$`, and a sort of continuity result regarding the generation of the genera. The efficiency of our method is supported by computational evidence. As a consequence, we single out the minimal possible Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity of a curve with Cohen–Macaulay postulation and given degree and genus.
