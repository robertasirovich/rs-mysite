**Abstract.** We construct stable vector bundles on the space of symmetric forms of degree `$d$` in `$n+1$` variables which are equivariant for the action of `$\text{SL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{C})$`, and admit an equivariant free resolution of length 2. For `$n=1$`, we obtain new examples of stable vector bundles of rank `$d-1$` on `$\mathbb{P}^d$`, which are moreover equivariant for `$\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$`. The presentation matrix of these bundles attains Westwick's upper bound for the dimension of vector spaces of matrices of constant rank and fixed size.
