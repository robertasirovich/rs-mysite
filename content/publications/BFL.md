**Abstract.** We give a new method to construct linear spaces of matrices of constant rank, based on truncated graded cohomology modules of certain vector bundles 
as well as on the existence of graded Artinian modules with pure resolutions. 
Our method allows one to produce several new examples, and provides an alternative point of view on the existing ones.
