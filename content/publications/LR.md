**Abstract.** The Gröbner stratum of a monomial ideal `$J$` is an affine variety that parametrizes the family of all ideals having `$J$` as initial ideal (with respect to a fixed term ordering). The Gröbner strata can be equipped in a natural way of a structure of homogeneous variety and are in a close connection with Hilbert schemes of subvarieties in the projective space `$\mathbb{P}^n$`. Using properties of the Gröbner strata we prove some sufficient conditions for the rationality of components of `$\mathbf{Hilb}_{p(z)}(\mathbb{P}^n)$`. We show for instance that all the smooth, irreducible components in `$\mathbf{Hilb}_{p(z)}(\mathbb{P}^n)$` (or in its support) and the Reeves and Stillman component `$H_{RS}$` are rational.
