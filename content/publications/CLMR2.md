**Abstract.** Let `$K$` be an algebraically closed field of null characteristic and `$p(z)$` a Hilbert polynomial. We look for the minimal Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity `$m_{p(z)}$` of closed subschemes of projective spaces over `$K$` with Hilbert polynomial `$p(z)$`. Experimental evidences led us to consider the idea that `$m_{p(z)}$` could be achieved by schemes having a suitable _minimal Hilbert function_. We give a constructive proof of this fact. Moreover, we are able to compute the minimal Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity `$m_{p(z)}^{\varrho}$` of schemes with Hilbert polynomial `$p(z)$` and given regularity `$\varrho$` of the Hilbert function, and also the minimal Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity `$m_u$` of schemes with Hilbert function `$u$`.

These results find applications in the study of Hilbert schemes. They are obtained by means of _minimal Hilbert functions_ and of two new constructive methods which are based on the notion of growth-height-lexicographic Borel set and called _ideal graft_ and _extended lifting_.
