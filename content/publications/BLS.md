**Abstract.** Let `$P_{\text{max}}(d,s)$` denote the maximum arithmetic genus of a locally Cohen-Macaulay curve  of degree `$d$` in `$\mathbb{P}^3$` that is not contained in a surface of degree `$< s$`. A bound `$P(d, s)$` for `$P_{\text{max}}(d,s)$` has been proven by the first author in characteristic zero and then generalized in any characteristic by the third author. In this paper, we construct a large family `$\mathcal{C}$` of primitive multiple lines and we conjecture that the generic element of `$\mathcal{C}$` has good cohomological properties. From the conjecture it would follow that  `$P(d,s)= P_{\text{max}}(d,s)$` for `$d=s$` and for every `$d \geq 2s-1$`. With the aid of _Macaulay2_ we checked this holds for `$s \leq 120$` by verifying our conjecture in the corresponding range.
