**Abstract.** Let `$p(t)$` be an admissible Hilbert polynomial in `$\mathbb{P}^n$` of degree `$d$`. The Hilbert scheme `$\mathbf{Hilb}_{p(t)}(\mathbb{P}^n)$` can be realized as a closed subscheme of a suitable Grassmannian `$\mathbf{Gr}$`, hence it could be globally defined by homogeneous equations in the Plücker coordinates of `$\mathbf{Gr}$` and covered by open subsets given by the non-vanishing of a Plücker coordinate, each embedded as a closed subscheme of the affine space `$\mathbb{A}^D$`, `$D=\dim(\mathbf{Gr})$`. However, the number `$E$` of Plücker coordinates is so large that effective computations in this setting are practically impossible. In this paper, taking advantage of the symmetries of `$\mathbf{Hilb}_{p(t)}(\mathbb{P}^n)$`, we exhibit a new open cover, consisting of marked schemes over Borel-fixed ideals, whose number is significantly smaller than `$E$`. Exploiting the properties of marked schemes, we prove that these open subsets are defined by equations of degree `$\leqslant d+2$` in their natural embedding in `$\mathbb{A}^D$`. Furthermore we find new embeddings in affine spaces of far lower dimension than `$D$`, and characterize those that are still defined by equations of degree `$\leqslant d+2$`. The proofs are constructive and use a polynomial reduction process, similar to the one for Gröbner bases, but are term order free. In this new setting, we can achieve explicit computations in many non-trivial cases.
