      <description>Abstract. The Gröbner stratum of a monomial ideal $J$ is an affine variety that parametrizes the family of all ideals having $J$ as initial ideal (with respect to a fixed term ordering). The Gröbner strata can be equipped in a natural way of a structure of homogeneous variety and are in a close connection with Hilbert schemes of subvarieties in the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$. Using properties of the Gröbner strata we prove some sufficient conditions for the rationality of components of $\mathbf{Hilb}_{p(z)}(\mathbb{P}^n)$.</description>

      <description>Abstract. Progress on the problem whether the Hilbert schemes of locally Cohen–Macaulay curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$ are connected has been hampered by the lack of an answer to a question raised by Robin Hartshorne in (Commun. Algebra 28:6059–6077, 2000) and more recently in (American Institute of Mathematics, Workshop components of Hilbert schemes, problem list, 2010, http://aimpl.org/hilbertschemes): does there exist a flat irreducible family of curves whose general member is a union of $d \geqslant 4$ disjoint lines on a smooth quadric surface and whose special member is a locally Cohen–Macaulay curve in a double plane?</description>

      <description>Abstract. Let $H_{d,g}$ denote the Hilbert scheme of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in projective three space. We show that, given a smooth irreducible curve $C$ of degree $d$ and genus $g$, there is a rational curve $\{[C_t]: t \in \mathbb{A}^1\}$ in $H_{d,g}$ such that $C_t$ for $t \neq 0$ is projectively equivalent to $C$, while the special fibre $C_0$ is an extremal curve. It follows that smooth curves lie in a unique connected component of $H_{d,g}$.</description>

      <title>The maximum genus problem for locally Cohen-Macaulay space curves</title>

      <description>Abstract. Let $P_{\text{max}}(d,s)$ denote the maximum arithmetic genus of a locally Cohen-Macaulay curve of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ that is not contained in a surface of degree $&amp;lt; s$. A bound $P(d, s)$ for $P_{\text{max}}(d,s)$ has been proven by the first author in characteristic zero and then generalized in any characteristic by the third author. In this paper, we construct a large family $\mathcal{C}$ of primitive multiple lines and we conjecture that the generic element of $\mathcal{C}$ has good cohomological properties.</description>
