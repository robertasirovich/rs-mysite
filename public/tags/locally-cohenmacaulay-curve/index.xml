      <description>Abstract. Progress on the problem whether the Hilbert schemes of locally Cohen–Macaulay curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$ are connected has been hampered by the lack of an answer to a question raised by Robin Hartshorne in (Commun. Algebra 28:6059–6077, 2000) and more recently in (American Institute of Mathematics, Workshop components of Hilbert schemes, problem list, 2010, http://aimpl.org/hilbertschemes): does there exist a flat irreducible family of curves whose general member is a union of $d \geqslant 4$ disjoint lines on a smooth quadric surface and whose special member is a locally Cohen–Macaulay curve in a double plane?</description>
